Your canteen expense tracker is now ready to use Firebase. Here's how to get started:

---

## 📁 **Step 1: Migrate Your Existing Data (Optional)**

If you have existing data in `data.json` that you want to keep:

### Option A: Use the Migration Tool (Recommended)
1. **Start local server:**
   - Double-click `start-local-server.bat`
   - Choose option 1, 2, or 3
   - Or use VS Code Live Server extension

2. **Open migration tool:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:8000/migrate-data.html`
   - Upload your `data.json` file
   - Click "Migrate Data to Firebase"
   - Verify the data appears in Firebase

### Option B: Start Fresh
- Skip this step if you want to start with a clean slate
- Your app will create default data automatically

## 🏃‍♂️ **Step 2: Start Your App**

### Method 1: Using the Batch File (Easiest)
```bash
# Double-click this file in Windows Explorer:
start-local-server.bat
```
Choose your preferred option (Python/Node.js) and the server will start.

### Method 2: Manual Command
Open PowerShell in your project folder (`e:\Canteen`) and run:
```bash
# If you have Python 3:
python -m http.server 8000

# If you have Python 2:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# If you have Node.js:
npx serve . -p 8000
```

### Method 3: VS Code Live Server
1. Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"
